# Endstone Inventory Manager

A comprehensive Endstone plugin that allows server administrators to view and manage player inventories and ender chests through an intuitive form-based interface. Supports both **online** and **offline** players!

## ✨ Features

### 🎮 Online Player Management
- **View Player Inventories**: Browse all slots in a player's inventory
- **View Ender Chests**: Access and manage player ender chest contents
- **Two View Modes**:
  - **Actions (List View)**: Perform operations on items
  - **View Only (Visual Chest)**: See items in a visual chest interface
- **Item Management**:
  - **Take**: Move items from player to your inventory (preserves NBT data)
  - **Copy**: Duplicate items to your inventory (preserves NBT data)
  - **Remove**: Clear items from slots
- **NBT Data Preservation**: Maintains enchantments, custom names, lore, shulker box contents, and all other NBT data

### 📦 Offline Player Support
- **Database-Powered**: Stores player inventory and ender chest data in SQLite database
- **View Offline Ender Chests**: Access ender chests of players who are offline
- **Copy Items**: Copy items from offline player ender chests to your inventory
- **Visual Display**: View offline ender chests in a visual chest interface
- **Read-Only Safety**: Cannot modify offline player data (view and copy only)
- **Text Search**: Search for players by name (supports partial matching and spaces)
- **NBT Fallback**: Falls back to reading NBT files for players who haven't joined since database was added

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Clean Menu Structure**: Organized hierarchical menus
- **Color-Coded Options**: Easy to distinguish between different actions

- **Real-time Updates**: Works with live player data

## 📥 Installation

### Basic Installation

1. Install the plugin using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install endstone-inventory-manager
   ```

2. Restart your Endstone server

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the plugin to your Endstone server's `plugins` directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install rapidnbt>=1.1.5
   pip install chest_form_api_endstone>=1.0.0
   ```
3. Restart your server

## 📋 Requirements

### Core Requirements
- **Endstone** >= 0.5.0
- **Python** >= 3.11
- **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** server

### Optional Dependencies (for full features)
- **rapidnbt** >= 1.1.5 (for offline player support)
- **chest_form_api_endstone** >= 1.0.0 (for visual chest display)

> **Note**: Without optional dependencies, the plugin will still work but offline player viewing will be disabled.

## 🗄️ Database System

The plugin uses an **SQLite database** to store player inventory and ender chest data for offline viewing.

### How It Works

1. **Auto-Save on Join/Leave**: When players join or leave the server, their inventory and ender chest data is automatically saved to the database
2. **Database-First Search**: When searching for offline players, the plugin queries the database first for fast results
3. **NBT Fallback**: If a player isn't in the database (e.g., they haven't joined since the plugin was installed), the plugin falls back to reading their `.dat` file
4. **Thread-Safe**: Uses SQLite's WAL mode and threading locks for safe concurrent access

### Database Location

```
plugins/inventory_manager_data/inventories.db
```

### Database Tables

- **users**: Stores player information (XUID, name, join/leave times)
- **inventories**: Stores player inventory items with full NBT data
- **ender_chests**: Stores ender chest items with full NBT data

### Data Stored

For each item, the database stores:
- Item type, amount, damage value
- Display name, lore, enchantments
- Unbreakable flag and other NBT data
- Slot position

> **Note**: The database is automatically created on first run. No manual setup required!

## 🎯 Usage

### Command

```
/manageinv
```

Opens the inventory manager interface.

### Permissions

- `inventory_manager.use` - Allows using the inventory manager (default: OP)

### Menu Structure

```
/manageinv
├── Online Players
│   ├── Select Player
│   │   ├── Inventory
│   │   │   ├── Actions (List View) - Take/Copy/Remove items
│   │   │   └── View Only (Visual Chest) - Read-only visual display
│   │   └── Ender Chest
│   │       ├── Actions (List View) - Take/Copy/Remove items
│   │       └── View Only (Visual Chest) - Read-only visual display
│
└── Offline Players (Ender Chest Only)
    ├── Text Search (Enter player name)
    │   └── If multiple matches → Select Player
    └── Selected Player's Ender Chest
        ├── Actions (List View) - Copy items only
        └── View Only (Visual Chest) - Read-only visual display
```

### Workflow Examples

#### Managing Online Player Inventory

1. Run `/manageinv`
2. Select **"Online Players"**
3. Choose a player to inspect
4. Select **"Inventory"**
5. Choose view mode:
   - **Actions (List View)**: Click an item → Take/Copy/Remove
   - **View Only (Visual Chest)**: See all items in chest interface

#### Viewing Offline Player Ender Chest

1. Run `/manageinv`
2. Select **"Offline Players (Ender Chest Only)"**
3. **Enter player name** in the text search box (supports partial matching and spaces)
4. If multiple matches found, select the correct player
5. Choose view mode:
   - **Actions (List View)**: Click an item → Copy to your inventory
   - **View Only (Visual Chest)**: See all items in chest interface

**Search Tips:**
- Search is case-insensitive: "steve" matches "Steve"
- Partial matching: "The B" finds "The Builder", "The Boss", etc.
- Supports spaces: "Player Name" works correctly
- Single match: Shows ender chest directly
- Multiple matches: Shows selection menu

### Item Actions Explained

- **Take**: Removes the item from the target player and adds it to your inventory (online players only)
- **Copy**: Duplicates the item to your inventory while keeping the original (works for both online and offline)
- **Remove**: Deletes the item from the slot (online players only)

> **Important**: All actions preserve NBT data including enchantments, custom names, lore, and shulker box contents!

## ⚙️ Configuration

No configuration required. The plugin works out of the box.

### World Folder Detection

The plugin automatically detects player data in these locations:
- `worlds/Bedrock level/players/`
- `worlds/world/players/`
- `Bedrock level/players/`
- `world/players/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Offline Players Button Not Showing

Check the server logs for:
```
[WARNING] Offline player viewing is DISABLED - missing dependencies
[WARNING]   - RapidNBT not found (install RapidNBT)
```

**Solution**: Install RapidNBT:
```bash
pip install rapidnbt>=1.1.5
```

### Player Data Folder Not Found

**Error**: "Player data folder not found"

**Solution**: The plugin will show which paths it tried. Make sure your world folder structure matches one of:
- `worlds/Bedrock level/players/`
- `worlds/world/players/`

### Visual Chest Not Working

**Solution**: Install ChestForm API:
```bash
pip install chest_form_api_endstone>=1.0.0
```

## 🎨 Color Codes

The plugin uses Minecraft color codes for clarity:

- **§a (Green)**: Online Players, available actions
- **§e (Yellow)**: Offline Players, action buttons
- **§b (Cyan)**: View Only options
- **§6 (Gold)**: Inventory
- **§d (Pink/Magenta)**: Ender Chest
- **§7 (Gray)**: Notes and descriptions
- **§c (Red)**: Close/Cancel buttons

## 📝 Permissions

```yaml
inventory_manager.use:
  description: Allows using the inventory manager
  default: op
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Offline players**: Only ender chests are accessible (not regular inventory)
- **Offline modifications**: Cannot modify offline player data (copy only)
- **NBT compatibility**: Some complex NBT structures may not display perfectly in visual mode
- **Inventory access**: Depends on Endstone API capabilities

## 🔒 Safety Features

- **Read-only offline access**: Offline player data is never modified
- **Inventory full checks**: Warns if your inventory is full before copying
- **Error handling**: Graceful failures with helpful error messages
- **Logging**: All operations are logged for debugging

## 📦 Dependencies

### Required
- `endstone` (automatically installed with Endstone)

### Optional
- `rapidnbt>=1.1.5` - For offline player NBT data reading
- `chest_form_api_endstone>=1.0.0` - For visual chest display

## 🐛 Bug Reports

If you encounter any issues, please check the server logs for error messages. Common issues are usually related to missing dependencies or incorrect world folder structure.
